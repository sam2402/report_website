              <p>
                To understand our project, it is important to have a basic understanding of
                Azure. It is a cloud computing platform offered by Microsoft that Volvo
                uses to host their sales infrastructure. A resource is an entity that
                represents a service or a piece of infrastructure that you can provision in
                the cloud. These might be virtual machines, storage accounts, databases,
                networking components, and web apps. Resources are located at one of
                Azure’s predefined regions, for example “uksouth” or “eastus”. A resource
                group is a logical container that helps you organize and manage related
                resources in Azure. Resource groups provide a way to group resources
                together, so you can manage them as a single entity. See the image below
                for a breakdown of this hierarchy:

            Avanade have provided us with access to three resources groups within their
            “Emerging Tech” subscription. Together these contain approximately 30
            resources.

              React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs)
              using a component-based architecture and virtual DOM, providing fast and
              efficient updates to UIs.
          </p>
          <p>
              We use React as a frontend to present real-time emission data from the
              backend to the user, it also allows us to handle user interactions such as
              filtering data and switching pages.

              Material-UI (MUI) is a UI library in React. It follows Google's Material
              Design guidelines to offer a comprehensive suite of UI tools, which helps
              developer to ship their new features faster.
          </p>
          <p>
              We used MUI to build a responsive and professional UI for our dashboard by
              its pre-built UI components such as borders and buttons.

              customisable and interactive chart components.
          </p>
          <p>
              We used Nivo's pre-built components such as line, bar, and pie charts to
              display emissions data. Nivo's animation is applied to provide dynamic
              effects to our charts, making the data more engaging.

              Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that provides tools and
              libraries for building web applications and APIs, with a simple and
              intuitive syntax and a modular design.
          </p>
          <p>
              We use Flask to build the backend API for the dashboard to allow the
              frontend to communicate with the server and retrieve data for display.
              Several API endpoints are built by Flask's routing system to handle
              requests for different data sets.

              applications and services that integrate with Microsoft Azure.
          </p>
          <p>
              In this project, we used the Azure SDK to carbon related data from Volvo,
              and displayed it on the dashboard, to provide information like real-time
              carbon emission data, CPU usage.

          </p>
          <p>
              By using pip, we were able to easily install the packages needed for the
              dashboard, such as Flask and the Azure SDK. This allowed us to quickly set
              up our development environment and easily check the version of the
              packages.

              We use Pandas to preprocess the data set to DataFrame format and then split
              the train and test set before we use the data to train the model to predict
              the future carbon emission data.

              the p &amp; q parameters. We use Matplotlib in differencing and Seasonality
              as well, just to plot the graphs help us catching the trend of Stationarity
              and Seasonality.

              We use the time series analysis model SARIMAX in Statsmodels as our ML
              model to predict the future carbon emission data. And we use the time
              series model ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) in
              Statsmodels in BIC function by iterating over all possible (p, q) in ARIMA
              model to help us choose the most suitable value.

              The view uses two endpoints: ‘/locations’ and

            <p>
              When this page mounts, it fetches the locations from the back end and then
              makes parallel HTTP requests to get the current emissions at each location.
              The map is populated when all these requests have resolved. Then it updates
              the data every 30 seconds using the setInterval function. This front end
              code is shown below:

            <p>To backend on receiving the current-emissions request makes a dictionary of all resources at in that location. This is speed up by using the resource cache in the Azure client. It then makes a request to get the last minute&rsquo;s emissions for each resource and sums them together to get a total for that region. This is done by making a request using the Azure SDK to get the computer value proxy which is then multiplied by the carbon emissions coefficient calculated from an Electricity Mapper past emissions request. This is returned as JSON with the following structure:</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The past emissions screen shows the past emissions for a resource group. The user can change which resource group using a drop-down selector. The past usage screen looks like this:</p>

            </div>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The past usage page begins by making a request to the / past-resource-emissions/&lt;resourceGroup&gt; endpoint. This occurs when the page loads and when the user changes which resource group they want to view. This is the sequence diagram of that request:</p>
          <div class="row">

            </div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We implemented a resource cache as we found getting the resources in a particular resource group via the Azure SDK to be a slow operation. This works by making a request to the Azure SDK is the cache is empty or over an hour old. This populates a dictionary of resource groups to a list of resources in that group which is stored in the AzureClient singleton. The cache itself is agnostic to its data source as one of its initialisation parameters is a fetch resources function; this takes advantage of functions being objects in Python.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works by making two parallel requests to get the data for each graph.</p>
<p>A cache is also used here as generating the predictions can take up to 30 seconds per resource. This would be too slow, so when the server starts it generates all the predictions before it serves its first request and stores them in a cache. This cache is updated every hour by a background process:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="row">
<div style="padding: 30px;">
  <img src="assets/img/Implementation Images/8.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
</div>
</div>
<p>
  The future emissions for a particular resource are calculated by passing
  its past emissions to this function:
</p>
<div class="row">
<div style="padding: 30px;">
  <img src="assets/img/Algorithm Implementation Images/1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
</div>
</div>
<p>
  When the program is called, it passes two parameters one is past_emissions
  which is a list of dictionary stores all the past_carbon emission in
  format: ex. [{"date":"2023-02-10 00:00:00","value":100.0},
  {"date":"2023-02-10 01:00:00","value":154.0}], future_date is a datetime
  type variable the exact time which we want to predict from now to. But to
  ensure the accuracy of the data, since our past_emissions data is only for
  the last 720 hours, which is a bit too little, we'd better predict only the
  next 3 days.
</p>
<p>
  After reading the data we first performed data cleaning and format
  conversion: using the pandas library to convert the data to a DataFrame,
  converting the 'date' column to datetime format and setting it as an index.
  Then we divided the data set into training set and test set, and we
  selected the last 360 hours as the training set to generate the prediction
  data. The conversion to DataFrame makes it easier to filter, sort and
  resample the data based on timestamps. We also need to slice the data and
  divide the dataset into a training set and a test set. This slicing
  operation can be easily performed using a DataFrame.
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div style="padding: 30px;">
    <img src="assets/img/Algorithm Implementation Images/2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Then we will call differencing.py to compute a difference order d that is
    appropriate for the data we now have in past_emissions.
</p>
<div class="row">
  <div style="padding: 30px;">
    <img src="assets/img/Algorithm Implementation Images/3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    After we read the data, we will do the data processing. First, we will use
    the pandas library to convert the data to a DataFrame. Then we will convert
    the 'date' column to datetime format and set it as an index. Set the
    initial I value to zero.
</p>
<div class="row">
  <div style="padding: 30px;">
    <img src="assets/img/Algorithm Implementation Images/4.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    After that, we will execute a while loop to check whether the existing data
    is stationary enough under the existing difference order, if not, we will
    perform another difference until the data is stationary enough, and then
    return the i value as the difference order.
</p>
<div class="row">
  <div style="padding: 30px;">
    <img src="assets/img/Algorithm Implementation Images/5.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Two functions are called in the while loop: one is
    calculate_stationarity(data): calculates the stationarity of the time
    series, using the adfuller function in statsmodels.tsa.stattools to perform
    the Dickey-Fuller test, the Dickey-Fuller test is a statistical method to
    test the stationarity of a time, series. In the Dickey-Fuller test, the
    assumption is that the series has a unit root, which means that the series
    is not stationary, and then we set a threshold value: 0.05, indicating that
    if the p-value is less than or equal to this threshold, the hypothesis is
    not valid, and the data is stationary. Conversely, the data is not
    stationary. The second one is difference (data, interval=1): calculates the
    difference of the time series.
</p>
<div class="row">
  <div style="padding: 30px;">
    <img src="assets/img/Algorithm Implementation Images/6.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Then we called the get_p_and_q_value function from BIC.py to help us find a
    function that picks the most appropriate p and q.
</p>
<div class="row">
  <div style="padding: 30px;">
    <img src="assets/img/Algorithm Implementation Images/7.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  </div>
  </div><p>
    As with any other program, we process the data first. Then we preset some
    variables, let's say the maximum p and q values are chosen to be 5, and
    then we preset a matrix of BIC using numpy.
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div style="padding: 30px;">
    <img src="assets/img/Algorithm Implementation Images/8.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  </div>
  </div>
  <p>
      The calculation of the BIC value is then performed through two for loops:
      for all possible combinations of (p, q) and the d values passed in as
      parameters, a model is created using the ARIMA class in
      statsmodels.tsa.arima.model, the model is fitted, and the BIC value is
      calculated. Afterwards, the numpy unravel_index function is used to locate
      the (p, q) combination corresponding to the minimum BIC value. Finally, the
      (p, q) combination corresponding to this minimum BIC value is returned as
      the best p and q values.
  </p>
<div class="row">
  <div style="padding: 30px;">
    <img src="assets/img/Algorithm Implementation Images/9.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    We then choose the p,d,q values that will be used in the previous two
    function calculations as the p,d,q values that will be used in our model.
</p>
<p>
    The reason we chose to do this manually instead of having it executed
    automatically like the first two sets of data ((p,q) and d) is that we only
    have access to the past month's data, which is a little too small. This
    amount of data is a bit too small, sometimes because the change in the data
    for the month is too small (most likely due to external factors), but we
    can clearly find that for each resource in each resource group (all our
    resources) we can find a clear peak value (at the same fixed hour of the
    day), but As I said before, sometimes this variation is too small (probably
    because of the influence of external factors on some dates), so it is not
    an option to use the program to calculate it automatically, because
    sometimes the seasonality of the data is ignored. So, first we know that
    the incoming data is hourly span, and then we know that the same hour of
    the day has a peak value, so we choose to set the m value to 24. Then we
    extract the data for that hour of the day and do a differential, and then
    do the BIC function to get the values of P and Q for most of the resources
    are chosen to be 1, which is the most appropriate. But as you can see, we
    have a completed program for detecting seasonality, and if there is longer
    Time series data, a larger data set, we can also set the seasonality
    parameters for automatic identification.
</p>
<div class="row">
  <div style="padding: 30px;">
    <img src="assets/img/Algorithm Implementation Images/10.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    This is the program we wrote to detect seasonality of data: our program
    reads a JSON file ("data.json") containing time series data, then
    seasonally decomposes the data, plots the seasonal component, and
    determines whether there is significant seasonality. If there is
    significant seasonality, the seasonal component is saved to another JSON
    file ("seasonal_data.json"). We then manually use the seasonal components
    to calculate P and Q. As in the previous procedure, we will use pandas to
    preprocess the data and then use the seasonal_decompose function for the
    seasonal decomposition and use the multiplicative model. Then plot the
    seasonal components. Finally, we will determine if the mean of the absolute
    values of the seasonal components is greater than 1. If the condition is
    met, we will save the seasonal components to the "seasonal_data.json" file,
    which will be used to calculate the P and Q values.

<p >First, we create a SARIMA model using the SARIMAX class. SARIMAX is a class in the statsmodels library that is used to construct and fit a SARIMA model.</p>
<p >Parameters of SARIMAX model:</p>
<p >train_data is the input training data, usually a time series dataset.</p>
<p >order= (p, d, q) specifies the three parameters of the ARIMA model and seasonal_order= (P, D, Q, m) specifies the four parameters of the seasonal ARIMA model. These seven parameters take the values of the seven parameters calculated in our previous paragraphs.</p>
<p >We then fit the SARIMA model using the fit() method. This method calculates the estimates of the model parameters using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). model_fit is a SARIMAXResults object that contains the model parameter estimates, model test statistics, diagnostic plots, and other information about the model fit results.</p>
<p >Overall, we obtain estimates of the model parameters by constructing a SARIMA model and fitting it with the given training data. These parameters will be used later to predict future time series data.</p>

<p >This code is where we will output the model summary information by printing model_fit.summary(), and model_fit.resid to calculate the residuals, and then plot the histogram and QQ plot to visualize the residuals: using the matplotlib.pyplot library to plot histogram and QQplot using the qqplot function in statsmodels.graphics.gofplots. These are to help us test our model when it is accurate.</p>
<p >But when we run the website if there is a drawing server will report an error, and we do not need to test if the model is accurate when running the web page. So, we choose to comment on these.</p>

<p >Then we called the calculate_step function to a step, which represents how many future data we will predict (hours as an interval).</p>

<p >First, we convert the &apos;date&apos; column in past_data to datetime format and set its time zone information to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) to ensure accurate date comparisons and calculations. This is because we have data from different time zones. Afterwards the time difference between the last two dates in past_data_dates is calculated, i.e., the time interval. Calculate the time difference between future_date and the last date in past_data_dates and convert it to a total number of seconds. Next, divide this time difference by the total number of seconds of time_delta to calculate the number of steps needed, also setting the time zone information of future_date to UTC. return the calculated number of steps. as the predicted number of hours in the future.</p>

          <p>Advice is generated by collecting data about all the resources part of the resource group or in a location, generating a prompt from that data then querying ChatGPT for that data. <strong>Using ChatGPT was at the suggestion of our client.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>Parrelel API calls are made for each advice type (energy type, location, resource configuration, cooling type) when the page mounts or the resource group or location is changed.</p>

          <p>This is an example data flow for a user wanting to get energy advice for the &ldquo;europenorth&rdquo; region:</p>
          <ul >
              <li>Front end makes a request to the backend with url: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/advice?location=europenorth&adviceType=%20energyType">http://127.0.0.1:5000/advice?location=europenorth&amp;adviceType= energyType</a></li>
              <li>All resources are put into a dictionary with this structure:</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="row">
            <div style="padding: 30px;">

          <ul >
              <li>Resources for which the condition &lsquo;resource.location === &ldquo;europenorth&rdquo;&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t hold removed from the list of resources</li>
              <li>For each matching resource a ResourceEmissionInfo object is created and added to a list called resource_emission_infos. The ResourceEmissionInfo class has the following definition:</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div style="padding: 30px;">

          <ul >
              <li>The attribute resource is the same as what was in the resources dictionary.</li>
              <li>The past weeks emissions are calculated by finding the emissions for that resource each day for the last week and summing them. The emissions for a particular resource are computed in the following way:<ol style="list-style-type: circle;">
                      <li>Each resource has a metrics type that we use to approximate the CPU usage. CPU usage is measured in CPU time where the equivalent number of seconds of a CPU working at 100% capacity is approximated. For example, for a web server resource type we use the &lsquo;transactions&rsquo; metric (this the number of API calls in the given time interval). We assume that each transaction has 100% CPU utilisation for 100ms. So, to get the equivalent number of CPU seconds we multiply the number of transactions by 0.1.</li>
                      <li>Then the CO2 per KWh at the location of the resource is computed from an API call to Electricity Map (an external data source). This is returned as a dictionary of times to CO2 per KWh. It has the following structure:</li>
                  </ol>
              </li>

          <p>E.g.. for the first item, at 16:00 on 15/3/2023 &ldquo;europenorth&rdquo; produced 175gCO₂eq/kWh. This can be converted to gCO₂eq/kWs by dividing by 3600 (number of seconds in an hour)</p>
          <ol style="list-style-type: circle;">
              <li>Each resource has a known CPU power rating. This might be 135 watts.</li>
              <li>By multiplying together the grams of CO₂(eq) per kWs at that location at a specific by the, power of the CPU by the number of CPU seconds we get an approximation for the grams of CO2 emitted.</li>
          </ol>
          <div>
              <ul >
                  <li>Power consumption breakdown, fossil free percentage and renewable percentage attributes are all retrieved by making a <a href="https://api.electricitymap.org/v3/power-breakdown/past">https://api.electricitymap.org/v3/power-breakdown/past</a> request to Electricity Mapper at the relevant longitude, latitude and time for the resource. The result of this request has the following structure:</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="row">

          <p><br></p>
          <p>The fossilFreePercentage and renewablePercentage attributes are taken as is. The powerConsumptionBreakdown attribute is changed so each value is a percentage between 0 and 100 instead of a number of grams of CO2.</p>

          <p >We first define a class called OpenAIClient, which implements a single instance client that interacts with the OpenAI API.</p>
          <p >It contains an __init__ method that initializes the OpenAI client with the API key in the environment variable.</p>
          <p >Then we have the __new__ method: implements the singleton pattern, ensuring that only one instance of OpenAIClient is generated.</p>
          <p >Then this is the get_advice method, which is also the method that will be called to get the advice: it will take a list of received resource emission information&nbsp;</span>>（resource_emission_infos）&nbsp;and an enumerated advice type&nbsp;（advice_type）&nbsp;and then call prompt_gen.get_prompt to generate the prompt. Next, it completes the specified prompt using the OpenAI API and returns the generated advice text.</p>
          <p >&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p >I&apos;ll talk more about the format of the get_prompt method generation below.</p>

          <p >We define this get_prompt Python function, which takes two parameters: a list of ResourceEmissionInfo objects and an AdviceType enumeration value. The goal of the function is to generate a prompt string containing detailed server information and a specific advice request, based on the input server information and advice type.</p>
          <p >&nbsp;</p>
          <p >It will iterate through the input list of resource_emission_infos and construct the server information based on the input advice_type enumeration value. Each advice type is given as</p>
          <p >&nbsp;</p>
          <p > Energy type (AdviceType.ENERGY_TYPE)</p>
          <p > Location (AdviceType.LOCATION)</p>
          <p > Resource Configuration (AdviceType.RESOURCE_CONFIGURATION)</p>
          <p > Cooling type (AdviceType.COOLING_TYPE)</p>
          <p >&nbsp;</p>
          <p >For each of the proposed types, the function constructs a prompt string associating with that type. The prompt string contains the server name, the current carbon emission value, and other information related to the advice type, such as power consumption, geographic location, CPU model, etc.</p>
          <p >&nbsp;</p>
          <p >Next, depending on the advice type, the function generates a request advice prompt string&nbsp;</span>>（request_advice_prompt）.</p>
          <p >&nbsp;</p>
          <p >Finally, the function joins the strings together and returns the prompt, which is then passed to the OpenAI API.</p>
