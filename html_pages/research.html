        <h2>Related Projects Review</h2>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        One of the projects we found that is very similar to ours is WattTime. Our
        project is looking at the carbon emissions from Volvo's sales software,
        specifically the carbon emissions from Volvo's data centres, servers and
        resource groups. And then WattTime is looking specifically at the carbon
        emissions of the entire grid, not just the carbon emissions of servers or
        data centres. However, since data centres and servers consume a lot of
        electricity, they are a significant part of the overall electricity
        consumption mix.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>
        Key features
    </h4>
    <p>
        The key features of this project are Server Carbon Emissions Monitoring:
        WattTime provides an API to monitor carbon emissions data from the grid in
        real time. The values from one of the data centres can be monitored and
        then used to calculate the carbon emissions of the servers. [1]
    </p>
    <p>
        Predictive Future Data: WattTime's API provides predictive data for future
        grid carbon emissions in addition to real-time data. [1]
    </p>
    <p>
        Future recommendations: One of the core features of WattTime is Automatic
        Emission Reduction (AER), which provides users with recommendations on when
        to use electricity to reduce carbon emissions. [2]
    </p>
    <p>
        The only unfortunate point is that WattTime itself cannot do data
        visualization, but WattTime's real-time carbon emissions data can be
        combined with other data visualization tools (such as Grafana or Tableau)
        to build dashboards to visualize a server's carbon emissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="800" height="400" src="assets/img/research/elecricityMap.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        An example is a real-time map of electricity emissions using WattTime data.
        This real-time map shows the CO2 emissions of electricity consumption on a
        global scale. While it is not designed specifically for WattTime, it uses
        data provided by WattTime.[3]
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>
        We can learn from this example:
    </h4>
    <p>
        The most important thing is that it gives us a good idea about detecting
        the power consumption consumed by data centres and converting it into
        carbon emission values.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data visualization is critical to better understand and present carbon
        emissions data. By using WattTime data in conjunction with other data
        visualization tools, you can help users visualize and analyze carbon
        emissions. This Electricity Map using WattTime data then gives us a good
        reference on how to visualize carbon emission values.
    </p>
    <p>
        The importance of forecasting data to help users understand future carbon
        emission trends in the grid in advance so they can take energy saving
        measures accordingly, so it gave us a great inspiration about using ML
        (Machine Learning) to forecast carbon emissions.
    </p>
    <p>
        WattTime's AER technology can provide users with suggestions on when to use
        electricity to reduce carbon emissions, which is a reference value for us
        to generate future suggestions to reduce carbon emission predictions.

        <h2>Dashboard design Review</h2>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Style 1: Flat designs</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Flat design is a style type with a focus on writing and text and uses
        simple 2d design with bright colours and multiple categories.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="800" height="700" src="assets/img/research/dashboard1.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Enroly – use of light theme and a single colour scheme [4]
    </p>
    <p>
    ● Contains 3 tabs which can be    <strong>switched from past and present data and future advice</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    ● <strong>Statistics </strong>are in bold and texts are    <strong>easy to read</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        ● Use <strong>of single colour scheme</strong> and gradients for all
        graphs/charts
    </p>
    <p>
    ● World maps/ pie charts and bar graphs all displayed in size    <strong>appropriate</strong> to its use
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="800" height="450" src="assets/img/research/dashboard2.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Use of dark theme and various colours
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="800" height="600" src="assets/img/research/dashboard3.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>Compact</strong> display, managing to fit a lot of data in a
        small space. Could also be bad due to cluttered look.
    </p>
    <p>
    ● Use of <strong>multiple vibrant colours</strong> to    <strong>contrast</strong> the black theme.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● Combined use of world maps, line graphs, pie charts and bar charts all in
        1 display with smaller graphs
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Style 2: Neomorphism</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This variant of design combines the old style of skeuomorphism and flat
        design together to create elements. Unlike Skeuomorphism, the elements are
        not representative of their real-life counterpart, which is like the flat
        design style. However instead of using 2d elements and vibrant colours like
        flat design, neomorphism uses 3d look alike elements with real life
        shadowing and a sense of depth is created with certain boxes pushed
        outwards and others inwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="800" height="500" src="assets/img/research/dashboard4.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Soft UI – 3d shadows and minimalistic design [5]
    </p>
    <p>
        Pros –
    </p>
    <p>
        ● Shadows under line graph
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>Minimalist</strong> design (no distracting display)
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>Premium</strong> and rich looking feel
    </p>
    <p>
        ● Easier for developers to design
    </p>
    <p>
        Cons –
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>Low contrast</strong> display so it’s hard to differentiate text
        and elements
    </p>
    <p>
        ● Due to shadows, much <strong>less space efficient</strong> display
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="400" height="300" src="assets/img/research/dashboard5.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="400" height="300" src="assets/img/research/dashboard6.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        ● Shadow under line graph gives the website a 3d feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="800" height="600" src="assets/img/research/dashboard7.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Tesla Cybertruck app [6]
    </p>
    <p>
        ● Visual which contains neon lights contrasted with Matt finish have a
        crisp look
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Comparison:</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        “The additional physicality that neomorphism brings to the table is a
        relief to users who are experiencing fatigue from the huge increase in
        screen time recently.” [7]
    </p>
    <p>
        As seen from this article or study, a majority prefer the flat design. This
        can be explained because the flat design makes it easier to comprehend and
        visualize the data. Since we are prioritizing functionality, it is
        important the stakeholders can see the various graphs and maps clearly.
        Furthermore, given the quantity of graphs and data that need to be
        presented to the user, the dashboard must also be space efficient. This
        means using a neumorph UI style will not be a good idea as a lot of space
        is required between each icon (if we consider a graph or map each as an
        icon). Instead, using flat design should be prioritised.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of light vs dark mode, the use of light mode makes the text easier
        to read when exposed to a bright working environment. Due to the lower
        contrast in daylight, light mode might make it harder to miss out important
        information compared to dark mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, dark mode has many advantages. It is easier on the eyes, meaning
        that workers don’t get eye strain given their job involves looking at
        computer screens for prolonged periods of time [8]. Furthermore, using an
        OLED display (organic light-emitting diode), it has been proven that the
        energy consumption “switching from light mode to dark mode at 100%
        brightness saves an average of 39%-47% battery power” [9]. Given Volvo’s
        original goal to reduce carbon emissions via servers and system
        infrastructures, dark mode is fitting for that reason.

        <h2>Front End Review</h2>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        In this project, a website will be produced which shows a dashboard of
        carbon emissions along with recommendations on how to reduce them. We have
        identified two key front-end tools that will be needed: a general-purpose
        JavaScript framework/library and a JavaScript charting library.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two of the most widely used and supported JavaScript frameworks/libraries
        are React and Angular; two of the most widely used and supported charting
        libraires are D3.js and chart.js.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Angular vs React
    </h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Type:</strong>
        Angular is a library developed by Google [14] and react is a full framework
        developed by Meta [10]. This means the bundle size of a fresh React project
        is smaller – however, this is unlikely to be a major concern in our project
        as we’re not limited by bundle size.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Device Support: </strong>
        Both React and Angular support both and desktop and mobile browsers.[11]
        This are unlikely to be a factor as the website developed for our project
        will only be needed to be designed for desktops. However, if in the future
        a mobile app is developed from our project Meta also has React Native which
        shares many of its key concepts with React making the learning curve for
        developers smaller.[12]
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Performance: </strong>
        React makes use of virtual DOM [13]. The code the developer writes only
        interacts with this layer and not the real DOM that takes considerably more
        time to update. This also allows the developer to store a UI like any other
        data. Angular however interacts with the real DOM making it generally
        slower. This could be a factor as we will have lost of changing UI elements
        in the DOM at any one time in the dashboard and it shouldn’t start the feel
        sluggish.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Learning Curve: </strong>
        We want to get started on the project quickly<strong> </strong>and not
        spend too much time learning new tools if they won’t yield significant
        benefit.[12] Angular is widely acknowledged to be more complex and
        difficult to learn than react. Taking time to learn Angular may not enable
        us to make a fully featured product.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Language: </strong>
        React is used with both JavaScript (ES6+) and JSX (to define virtual DOM
        elements), whereas Angular can be used with JavaScript or TypeScript.
        TypeScript has the many advantages of a typed language with JavaScript
        lacks. This is a factor for us as, especially when working in a team, being
        able to see the types of data makes code safer and more readable.[14]
    </p>
    <h4>
    </h4>
    <h4>
        Chart.js vs D3.js
    </h4>
    <p>
      <img width="800" height="500" src="assets/img/research/front1.png"/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <img width="800" height="400" src="assets/img/research/front2.png"/>
        <strong></strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Complexity: </strong>
        D3 is a complex data visualisation tool whereas Chart is a simple charting
        tool. D3 requires a stepper learning curve and more theoretical
        understanding of frontend web development as the developer must interact
        directly with the DOM. This makes it a far more flexible tool. However,
        there are libraries that are built on top of D3 such as Nivo that abstract
        some of this complexity away.[12]
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Compatibility with React and Angular:</strong>
        Both libraries do not natively support React or Angular but there are many
        libraries that aid with integration such as react-chartjs-2 and Nivo.[11]
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Feature Set: </strong>
        D3 supports more types of data visualisation such as a circular bar plot
        and distribution graphs that Chart doesn’t support. You can also have
        custom animations and gradients unlike Chart. This comes at the cost off
        added technical overhead.[10]
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Performance: </strong>
        Both libraries support datasets with millions of points. More of a concern
        is getting the data to the front end in an efficient way – this is not
        impacted by the choice of data visualisation library.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Conclusion
    </h4>
    <p>
        Due to the wide community support, low learning curve and easy integration
        with Nivo, React is likely the best choice of front end tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will have complex data visualisation requirements so D3.js will likely
        be the best choice of graphing tool. However, to reduce the learning curve
        we will use it with a Nivo layer which abstracts away some of the complex
        direct DOM manipulation. It also creates native React elements which will
        reduce the difficultly of integration.

        <h2>Back End Review</h2>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        Regarding the website we are designing, the dashboard about carbon emission
        with suggestion that reduce it. We need two main back-end tools, a REST API
        and a database.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this literature review we are going to compare Django, Flask and
        Node.js, and two widely used database: MySQL and MongoDB.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Django vs. Flask vs. Node.js
    </h4>
    <p>
        Lets’ compare Django and Flask first, both these two are Python-based web
        developing frameworks. Then compare Flask with Node.js, the details compare
        Django and Flask above would be helpful in selecting the frameworks.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Django vs. Flask
    </h4>
    <p>
        Default Admin: Both frameworks have a bootstrapped admin application. The
        distinction is that it is integrated into Django and requires a superuser.
        However, to develop an admin interface, you must install Flask-Appbuilder,
        and admin is necessary to administer the backend via the browser. [15]
    </p>
    <p>
        Views and Routes: Both frameworks include ways for declaring methods-based
        class-based views. Because they are segregated in distinct files in Django,
        we must explicitly send request objects. A decorator in flask is necessary
        to indicate the routes for the relevant handlers. The request objects are
        global and may be accessed without being explicitly passed around. [15]
    </p>
    <p>
        Forms and Templates: Django's forms are incorporated into the framework and
        may be provided to template tags. However, Flask-WTF is necessary in Flask,
        and WTF-Alembic may be used to produce HTML forms based on databased
        models. [16]
    </p>
    <p>
        Learning Curve: It almost requires the same amount of time to learn both
        Django and Flask, because we all know python programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Development efficiency: Not that important, Flask with plugins = Django
    </p>
    <p>
        Performance: Flask framework is lighter than Django, and performs better
        with negligible differences, especially while considering I/O operations
    </p>
    <h3>
        Flask vs. Node.js
    </h3>
    <p>
        First and foremost, Node.js works as a JavaScript runtime environment on
        the server, allowing only one language to be used up and down the stack,
        allowing us to move easily between various portions of the project in
        theory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Flask: Python, Non-blocking I/O requires the use of non-blocking web
        servers, Slow speed (cause of separated Python interpreter), Easier to
        debug with python debugger with no dependencies, Low Maintenance[15]
    </p>
    <p>
        Node.js: Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine, inherently Provides non-blocking
        I/O, Faster speed, Requires more effort. Easier with a Development IDE with
        Bluebird / Promise Library, Higher Maintenance
    </p>
    <h4>
        MySQL vs. MongoDB
    </h4>
    <p>
        The core of these two systems is alike, both are DBMS. And they support
        many same languages: Java, Python, Nodes.js, there is no worries when we
        are choosing the matching API and databases.
    </p>
    <p>
        MongoDB is a document-based non-relational DBMS. It’s called object-based
        system. It was designed to supplant the MySQL structure as easier way to
        work with data.[16]
    </p>
    <p>
        MySQL is a table-based relational DBMS. The table-based design is the data
        query structure for search, and is an SQL database, and a feature that
        MongoDB does not support is that table joins. Relating two tables together
        would help us when searching the data.[16]

      <h4>
          Linear Regression
      </h4>
      <p>
          Linear regression is a simple supervised learning algorithm, it is used to
          predict the value based on the given set of values. Linear regression fits
          a straight line or surface that minimizes the discrepancies between
          predicted and actual output values [17]
      </p>
      <p>
          In our carbon analysis model, we could use it to find a curve that’s fit
          our graph to figure out the trend of past carbon emission data, and based
          on it, provide the future prediction of the carbon emission.
      </p>
      <h3>
          Advantages:
      </h3>
      <p>
          <strong>Performance</strong>
          : On linearly separable datasets Linear regression fits linearly separable
          datasets almost perfectly and is often used to find the nature of the
          relationship between variables.
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>Overfitting can be reduced by regularisation</strong>
          : Overfitting is a situation that arises when a machine learning model fits
          a dataset very closely and hence captures the noisy data as well. This
          negatively impacts the performance of the model and reduces its accuracy on
          the test set. Regularisation is a technique that can be easily implemented
          and is capable of effectively reducing the complexity of a function to
          reduce the risk of overfitting.
      </p>
      <h3>
          Disadvantages:
      </h3>
      <p>
          <strong>Prone to underfitting</strong>
          : A situation that arises when a machine learning model fails to capture
          the data properly. This typically occurs when the hypothesis function
          cannot fit the data well.
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>Sensitive to outliers</strong>
          : Outliers of a data set are anomalies or extreme values that deviate from
          the other data points of the distribution. Data outliers can damage the
          performance of a machine learning model drastically and can often lead to models with
          low accuracy.
      </p>
      <h4>
          Solution to these disadvantages:
      </h4>
      <p>
          1. In our carbon emission model, data are regular, to the linear regression
          should be easy to capture the data and create a fit curve.
      </p>
      <p>
          2. Since it's sensitive to outliers, we should detect and eliminate the
          illegal data before applying linear regression to our model. Fortunately,
          the K-means algorithm could tackle this problem as well.
      </p>
      <h3>
          SARIMA Model
      </h3>
      <p>
          The SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) [18] model
          is a popular time series forecasting method for dealing with time series
          data with seasonal variations. The SARIMA model is an extension of the
          ARIMA model with the addition of a seasonal component. The ARIMA model
          consists of three components: autoregressive (AR), differential integrated
          (I) and moving average (MA). The AR component represents the relationship
          between current and past values, the MA component represents the
          relationship between current values and past error terms, and the I
          component represents the conversion of a non-stationary time series into a
          stationary time series. [18]
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong> </strong>
          <strong></strong>
      </p>
      <h3>
          Advantage:
      </h3>
      <p>
          Flexibility: SARIMA models can be adapted to different types of time series
          data by adjusting the orders of AR, I and MA, and by is allowing the model
          to adapt to the data will give us a good fit to the forecast data.
      </p>
      <p>
          Simple structure: Compared to other complex machine learning models, this
          model is simple and easier to implement and modify the parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
          Seasonality: As an extension of ARIMA model, it can better handle seasonal
          data and capture the seasonality to improve the accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong> </strong>
      </p>
      <h3>
          Disadvantage:
      </h3>
      <p>
          Dependence of parameter selection: The performance of the model depends
          heavily on the choice of parameters, and if the parameters are not chosen
          properly, then the model will predict inaccurately.
      </p>
      <p>
          Long-term prediction: The model does not perform well on long-term data
          prediction, and the accuracy of the prediction decreases as the prediction
          time goes on.[15]
      </p>
      <p>
          Lack of consideration of other data: This model focuses on the relationship
          between the data itself and the past data and does not consider the impact
          of other factors on carbon emissions.
