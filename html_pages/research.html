              <strong>Style 1: Flat designs</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
              Flat design is a style type with a focus on writing and text and uses
              simple 2d design with bright colours and multiple categories.

              small space. Could also be bad due to cluttered look.

          </p>
          <p>
              ● Combined use of world maps, line graphs, pie charts and bar charts all in

          <p>
              <strong>Style 2: Neumorphism</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
              This variant of design combines the old style of skeuomorphism and flat
              design together to create elements. Unlike Skeuomorphism, the elements are
              not representative of their real-life counterpart, which is similar to the
              flat design style. However instead of using 2d elements and vibrant colours
              like flat design, neomorphism uses 3d look alike elements with real life
              shadowing and a sense of depth is created with certain boxes pushed
              outwards and others inwards.

          </p>
          <p>
              Pros –
          </p>
          <p>
              ● Shadows under line graph

              Cons –
          </p>
          <p>
              ● <strong>Low contrast</strong> display so it’s hard to differentiate text
              and elements
          </p>
          <p>
              ● Due to shadows, much <strong>less space efficient</strong> display

              “The additional physicality that neomorphism brings to the table is a
              relief to users who are experiencing fatigue from the huge increase in
              screen time recently.” [4]
          </p>
          <p>
              As seen from this article or study, a majority prefer the flat design. This
              can be explained because the flat design makes it easier to comprehend and
              visualize the data. Since we are prioritizing functionality, it is
              important the stakeholders can see the various graphs and maps clearly.
              Furthermore, given the quantity of graphs and data that need to be
              presented to the user, the dashboard must also be space efficient. This
              means using a neumorph UI style will not be a good idea as a lot of space
              is required between each icon (if we consider a graph or map each as an
              icon). Instead, using flat design should be prioritised.
          </p>
          <p>
              In terms of light vs dark mode, the use of light mode makes the text easier
              to read when exposed to a bright working environment. Due to the lower
              contrast in daylight, light mode might make it harder to miss out important
              information compared to dark mode.
          </p>
          <p>
              However, dark mode has many advantages. It is easier on the eyes, meaning
              that workers don’t get eye strain given their job involves looking at
              computer screens for prolonged periods of time [5]. Furthermore, using an
              OLED display (organic light-emitting diode), it has been proven that the
              energy consumption “switching from light mode to dark mode at 100%
              brightness saves an average of 39%-47% battery power” [6]. Given Volvo’s
              original goal to reduce carbon emissions via servers and system
              infrastructures, dark mode is fitting for that reason.
          </p>

          </h1>
          <p>
              In this project, a website will be produced which shows a dashboard of
              carbon emissions along with recommendations on how to reduce them. We have
              identified two key front end tools that will be needed: a general purpose
              JavaScript framework/library and a JavaScript charting library.
          </p>
          <p>
              Two of the most widely used and supported JavaScript frameworks/libraries
              are React and Angular; two of the most widely used and supported charting
              libraires are D3.js and chart.js.
          </p>
          <h2>
              Angular vs React
          </h2>
          <p>
              <strong>Type:</strong>
              Angular is a library developed by Google[11] and React is a full framework
              developed by Meta[7]. This means the bundle size of a fresh React project
              is smaller – however, this is unlikely to be a major concern in our project
              as we’re not limited by bundle size.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Device Support: </strong>
              Both React and Angular support both and desktop and mobile browsers.[8]
              This is unlikely to be a factor as the website developed for our project
              will only needed to be designed for desktops. However, if in the future a
              mobile app is developed from our project Meta also has React Native which
              shares many of its key concepts with React making the learning curve for
              developers smaller.[9]
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Performance: </strong>
              React makes use of virtual DOM[10]. The code the developer writes only
              interacts with this layer and not the real DOM that takes considerably more
              time to update. This also allows the developer to store a UI like any other
              data. Angular however interacts with the real DOM making it generally
              slower. This could be a factor as we will have lost of changing UI elements
              in the DOM at any one time in the dashboard and it shouldn’t start the feel
              sluggish.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Learning Curve: </strong>
              We want to get started on the project quickly<strong> </strong>and not
              spend too much time learning new tools if they won’t yield significant
              benefit.[9] Angular is widely acknowledged to be more complex and difficult
              to learn than React. Taking time to learn Angular may not enable us to make
              a fully featured product.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Language: </strong>
              React is used with both JavaScript (ES6+) and JSX (to define virtual DOM
              elements), whereas Angular can be used with JavaScript or TypeScript.
              TypeScript has the many advantages of a typed language with JavaScript
              lacks. This is a factor for us as, especially when working in a team, being
              able to see the types of data makes code safer and more readable.[11]

              <strong>Complexity: </strong>
              D3 is a complex data visualisation tool whereas Chart is a simple charting
              tool. D3 requires a stepper learning curve and more theoretical
              understanding of frontend web development as the developer must interact
              directly with the DOM. This makes it a far more flexible tool. However,
              there are libraries that are built on top of D3 such as Nivo that abstract
              some of this complexity away.[9]
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Compatibility with React and Angular:</strong>
              Both libraries do not natively support React or Angular but there are many
              libraries that aid with integration such as react-chartjs-2 and Nivo.[8]
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Feature Set: </strong>
              D3 supports more types of data visualisation such as a circular bar plot
              and distribution graphs that Chart doesn’t support. You can also have
              custom animations and gradients unlike Chart. This comes at the cost off
              added technical overhead.[7]
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Performance: </strong>
              Both libraries support datasets with millions of points. More of a concern
              is getting the data to the front end in an efficient way – this is not
              impacted by the choice of data visualisation library.
          </p>
          <h2>
              Conclusion
          </h2>
          <p>
              Due to the wide community support, low learning curve and easy integration
              with Nivo, React is likely the best choice of front end tool.
          </p>
          <p>
              We will have complex data visualisation requirements so D3.js will likely
              be the best choice of graphing tool. However, to reduce the learning curve
              we will use it with a Nivo layer which abstracts away some of the complex
              direct DOM manipulation. It also creates native React elements which will
              reduce the difficult of integration.

              Back End Literature Review
          </h1>
          <p>
              Regarding the website we are designing, the dashboard about carbon emission
              with suggestion that reduce it. We need two main back-end tools, a REST API
              and a database.
          </p>
          <p>
              In this literature review we are going to compare Django, Flask and
              Node.js, and two widely used database: MySQL and MongoDB.
          </p>
          <p>
              Django vs. Flask vs. Node.js
          </p>
          <p>
              Lets’ compare Django and Flask first, both these two are Python-based web
              developing frameworks. Then compare Flask with Node.js, the details compare
              Django and Flask above would be helpful in selecting the frameworks.
          </p>
          <p>
              Django vs. Flask
          </p>
          <p>
              Default Admin: Both frameworks have a bootstrapped admin application. The
              distinction is that it is integrated into Django and requires a superuser.
              However, to develop an admin interface, you must install Flask-Appbuilder,
              and admin is necessary to administer the backend via the browser. [12]
          </p>
          <p>
              Views and Routes: Both frameworks include ways for declaring methods-based
              class-based views. Because they are segregated in distinct files in Django,
              we must explicitly send request objects. A decorator in flask is necessary
              to indicate the routes for the relevant handlers. The request objects are
              global and may be accessed without being explicitly passed around. [12]
          </p>
          <p>
              Forms and Templates: Django's forms are incorporated into the framework and
              may be provided to template tags. However, Flask-WTF is necessary in Flask,
              and WTF-Alembic may be used to produce HTML forms based on databased
              models. [13]
          </p>
          <p>
              Learning Curve: It almost requires the same amount of time to learn both
              Django and Flask, because we all know python programming.
          </p>
          <p>
              Development efficiency: Not that important, Flask with plugins = Django
          </p>
          <p>
              Performance: Flask framework is lighter than Django, and performs better
              with negligible differences, especially while considering I/O operations
          </p>
          <p>
              Flask vs. Node.js
          </p>
          <p>
              First and foremost, Node.js works as a JavaScript runtime environment on
              the server, allowing only one language to be used up and down the stack,
              allowing us to move easily between various portions of the project in
              theory.
          </p>
          <p>
              Flask: Python, Non-blocking I/O requires the use of non-blocking web
              servers, Slow speed (cause of separated Python interpreter), Easier to
              debug with python debugger with no dependencies, Low Maintenance[12]
          </p>
          <p>
              Node.js: Chorme’s V8 JavaScript Engine, inherently Provides non-blocking
              I/O, Faster speed, Requires more effort. Easier with a Development IDE with
              Bluebird / Promise Library, Higher Maintenance
          </p>
          <p>
              MySQL vs. MongoDB
          </p>
          <p>
              The core of these two systems is alike, both are DBMS. And they support
              many same languages: Java, Python, Nodes.js, there is no worries when we
              are choosing the matching API and databases.
          </p>
          <p>
              MongoDB is a document-based non-relational DBMS. It’s called object-based
              system. It was designed to supplant the MySQL structure as easier way to
              work with data.[13]
          </p>
          <p>
              MySQL is a table-based relational DBMS. The table-based design is the data
              query structure for search, and is an SQL database, and a feature that
              MongoDB does not support is that table joins. Relating two tables together
              would help us when searching the data.[13]

              <strong>Linear Regression</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
              Linear regression is a simple supervised learning algorithm, it is used to
              predict the value based on the given set of values. Linear regression fits
              a straight line or surface that minimizes the discrepancies between
              predicted and actual output values[14]
          </p>
          <p>
              In our carbon analysis model, we could use it to find a curve that’s fit
              our graph to figure out the trend of past carbon emission data, and based
              on it, provide the future prediction of the carbon emission.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Advantages</strong>
              <strong> </strong>
              :
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Performance</strong>
              : On linearly separable datasets Linear regression fits linearly separable
              datasets almost perfectly and is often used to find the nature of the
              relationship between variables.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Overfitting can be reduced by regularisation</strong>
              : Overfitting is a situation that arises when a machine learning model fits
              a dataset very closely and hence captures the noisy data as well.This
              negatively impacts the performance of the model and reduces its accuracy on
              the test set. Regularisation is a technique that can be easily implemented
              and is capable of effectively reducing the complexity of a function to
              reduce the risk of overfitting.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Disadvantages</strong>
              <strong> </strong>
              :
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Prone to underfittin</strong>
              : A situation that arises when a machine learning model fails to capture
              the data properly. This typically occurs when the hypothesis function
              cannot fit the data well.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Sensitive to outliers</strong>
              : Outliers of a data set are anomalies or extreme values that deviate from
              the other data points of the distribution.Data outliers can damage the
              performance
          </p>
          <p>
              of a machine learning model drastically and can often lead to models with
              low
          </p>
          <p>
              accuracy.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Solution to these disadvantages</strong>
              <strong> </strong>
              :
          </p>
          <p>
              1. In our carbon emission model, data are regular, to the linear regression
              should be easy to capture the data and create a fit curve.
          </p>
          <p>
              2. Since it's sensitive to outliers, we should detect and eliminate the
              illegal data before applying linear regression to our model. Fortunately,
              the K-means algorithm could tackle this problem as well.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>SARIMA Model</strong>
              <strong></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
              The SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)[15] model is
              a popular time series forecasting method for dealing with time series data
              with seasonal variations. The SARIMA model is an extension of the ARIMA
              model with the addition of a seasonal component. The ARIMA model consists
              of three components: autoregressive (AR), differential integrated (I) and
              moving average (MA).The AR component represents the relationship between
              current and past values, the MA component represents the relationship
              between current values and past error terms, and the I component represents
              the conversion of a non-stationary time series into a stationary time
              series.[

          <p>
              <strong> </strong>
              <strong></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Advantage:</strong>
              <strong></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
              Flexibility: SARIMA models can be adapted to different types of time series
              data by adjusting the orders of AR, I and MA, and by is allowing the model
              to adapt to the data will give us a good fit to the forecast data.
          </p>
          <p>
              Simple structure: Compared to other complex machine learning models, this
              model is simple and easier to implement and modify the parameters.
          </p>
          <p>
              Seasonality: As an extension of ARIMA model, it can better handle seasonal
              data and capture the seasonality to improve the accuracy.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong> </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Disadvantage:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
              Dependence of parameter selection: The performance of the model depends
              heavily on the choice of parameters, and if the parameters are not chosen
              properly, then the model will predict inaccurately.
          </p>
          <p>
              Long-term prediction: The model does not perform well on long-term data
              prediction, and the accuracy of the prediction decreases as the prediction
              time goes on.[15]
          </p>
          <p>
              Lack of consideration of other data: This model focuses on the relationship
              between the data itself and the past data, and does not take into account
              the impact of other factors on carbon emissions.
